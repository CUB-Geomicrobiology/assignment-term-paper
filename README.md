# Term Paper Assignment

The term paper assignment is different for students enrolled in the undergraduate vs. graduate version of this class. Please take a look at the respective sections and general tips for both assignments below. You may submit your term paper / proposal as markdown ([`term_paper.md`](term_paper.md)), google doc ([`term_paper_gdoc.md`](term_paper_gdoc.md)), or upload it to the repository as a Word file (.docx) - whichever you prefer. In either case, make sure to still upload your figure separately to the repository. A first draft of your paper is due before Thanksgiving break and should be submitted to two of your teammates for review. You have until the last day of classes to incorporate your teammates' feedback and submit the final version. See details on review and submission below.

### Assignment for students enrolled in the 4700 level class

For this assignment, you will write a 2500-3000 word paper on your term topic addressing the following overarching questions:

1. Why is this topic important? This includes background and context on what the topic is about and why we should care.
2. What is the state of knowledge on this topic? This includes a discussion of prior observations from published work that are relevant to the current state of knowledge on the topic.
3. What are some interesting future directions for research on this topic? This may include a discussion of an important unsolved problem or promising new research direction on the topic.

Your paper must include at least one original color figure that helps explain an important aspect of why the topic is important, the current state of knowledge, or your conclusions/recommendations; a reference list with 8 or more refereed sources; and 2500-3000 words in total including figure captions but excluding references. The overall structure of your term paper is up to you, however, it may be helpful to divide it at the very least into a section on Background/Context, a section on Observations, and a section on Conclusions/Recommendations. Write with your fellow geomicrobiology classmates as the target audience. Throughout the writing process, ask yourself is it **comprehensible**, **comprehensive**, and **concise**? If you have any questions, come talk to me. You may re-use some aspects of your latest & greatest for this assignment if applicable (e.g. parts of the background, but not the figure itself). For details on the grading rubrics, see the grading section below.

### Assignment for students enrolled in the 5700 level class

As a newly minted graduate student your first assignment is to raise money to support your research project – welcome to the real world, kiddo. You have tentatively identified the Inigo Montoya Charitable Foundation as a good target of opportunity for those funds. Thus your assignment is to prepare a short research proposal for a 2-year project on something related to your term topic. It should be something of real scientific interest and you can use a project that you are already thinking about for your research as a starting point, but it obviously cannot be something that you have previously written. If you have any doubts, come talk to me. The scope of work required to complete the project should be something that one graduate student could reasonably complete in 2 years. The proposal should be 2500-3000 words (excluding references), and should at a minimum include the following information:

- What questions are you trying to answer, and why are they important questions to answer? What is the relevance to society? What will be the products of a successful project? This is basically the sales pitch - how well can you convince people that this project is worth doing.
- What is your general research approach? How is it new or different or better than past research efforts? What are the chances for success (and how do they compare to the perceived societal benefits; risky projects can be tolerated if the potential payoff is huge), and what is the worst-case scenario if things don’t work out as planned?
- What is your specific plan of research? This should include what samples you need, how they will be collected and prepared, what lab experiments you want to perform (if any), and what analytical methods you would employ. If your proposed project has a field component, include specific field locations if possible for sampling. If the analytical methods are new, can you be sure that they will work for your samples? You need enough details to convince a technically savvy reviewer that your proposed research is feasible, and that their money won’t be wasted on something that will never work (the proverbial ‘train wreck’).

Your research proposal will be reviewed by a group of scientists with mixed backgrounds – everything from biologists to mathematicians to geochemists. Thus a major challenge for you will be explaining the importance of the research in terms that everyone can understand, while still providing enough technical details to show that you know what you are talking about. Figures are often a great way to convey information in a limited space and you should include at least one towards this goal.

## Tips

### How to make the figure?

Same as in the latest & greatest assignment: if you have a preferred graphics program that you are already familiar with, feel free to use it for this figure. If you don't already have one, I recommend using the very well-designed free vector graphics program [Gravit Designer](https://gravit.io/) (you can [download it](https://designer.io/#download) for offline use, [use it online](https://designer.gravit.io/) without creating an account, or [use it online with an account](https://cloud.gravit.io/signup) so you can store your designs in the cloud). No matter whether you use markdown, google docs or Word, make sure that you save a copy of your figure in **.pdf**, **.png**, or **.jpeg/.jpg** format in the **figures** folder. In [Gravit Designer](https://designer.gravit.io/), you can get a PNG, for example, via `File -> Export -> PNG Image (.png)`. In terms of figure content - think about what could help visually explain a fundamental aspect, mechanism, approach or experiment central to your term paper? If you don't know where to start, try to identify what might be the most important or complicated aspect of your term paper. Think about how you would explain that to someone else with a whiteboard and a few markers as the only props - what would you draw? how would you visualize it? It can be helpful to sketch a few figure ideas by hand first before making a digital version.

### How to format the references?

Same as in the latest & greatest assignment: list all your references in **alphabetical** order (by the last name of the first author). You should have at least 8 references. All references should include a link to the journal's online version of the referenced article (unless the article is so old it isn't available online) and the reference text needs to include at a minimum: author last name(s), title, journal and year. The exact reference style and formatting is up to you. However, you have to be consistent, all references should be formatted the same way. Make sure that all your references are mentioned at least once in the main text and include both author and year when referencing.

### How to submit the term paper for review and grading?

1. Write your assignment either in markdown ([`term_paper.md`](term_paper.md)), google doc ([`term_paper_gdoc.md`](term_paper_gdoc.md)) or upload it to the repository as a word file.
2. Submit a draft of your assignment to the `review` branch for review by two of your teammates by the draft deadline (see [schedule](https://2017-geomicrobiology.github.io/schedule/)) - do this by creating a pull request with `review` as the base branch and two of your teammates as the reviewers (coordinate with your team to make sure everyone knows who to request as reviewers). Your teammates will do the same and it is your responsibility to review two of your teammates term paper. Re-watch the [Reviews Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/ZWMN5FxgdWI) if you don't remember how to add your team as collaborators to your repository and request reviews from them. If a teammate submits their draft as a google doc, open their google doc and switch to `Suggesting` mode in the upper right corner (the dropdown that says `Editing`) to leave your comments. If your teammate submits their draft as a word file (.docx), download the word file and add your review comments directly in the file but make sure to provide feedback with the track changes feature turned on (`Menu -> Tools -> Track Changes`) and upload your reviewed version of the word file with a new name (e.g. suffix `_reviewer_name.docx`) to their repository.
3. Review the drafts of two of your teammates by the peer review deadline.
4. Write your final term paper by the final submission deadline.
5. On the second to last day of classes, you will be expected to give a brief (2 minute) summary of your term paper in class (same as for the L&G, you will have the figure available as a slide).
6. Submit to the `submit` branch by the last class: i.e. create a pull request with `submit` as the base branch and your instructor as the reviewer. Your grade will be based entirely on the content of this final version.

## Grading

Your grade will be based entirely on the content of the final submission.
